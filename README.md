# Hello-World
This is my first repository (nervous laughter).

Oh no.

How did we get here? How do I stop this? Where are the real adults when I need them? Consider this my plea for help.

[awkward pause]

Okay, I will just...ramble on about myself then. Well, ahem, as you might have guessed, Dolorem Ipsum is not my real name. 

[audience gasps]

I know. I know. I was disappointed too. But, really, I am a quirky, spastic, awkward writer that finds coding much like sorcery; a cave; an escape. I would pretend to be modest and say "I'm nothing special," but really I am--very special. I know. I've heard it many times. Well, without further ado, I present to you my best attempt at this whole life thing--oh and Github too, I guess.
